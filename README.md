# Spam_mail_identifier
This project is a Machine Learning based Email Spam Detection System developed using Python. The goal of this project is to classify incoming emails as “Spam” or “Not Spam” by analyzing their textual content. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess email text and uses a trained model to predict the category of any given message.

🚀 Features

Uses NLP preprocessing techniques like:

Tokenization

Stop-word removal

Stemming / Lemmatization

TF-IDF Vectorization
